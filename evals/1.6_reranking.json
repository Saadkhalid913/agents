An MLP neuron, however, \"is free to either perform classification or regression, depending upon its activation function\" (Document 1).\n\nIn summary, the single layer perceptron is a more restricted, special case of artificial neuron with fixed threshold activation and binary output, while the multilayer perceptron represents a more flexible architecture with multiple layers of neurons capable of arbitrary activation functions and both classification and regression tasks.",
