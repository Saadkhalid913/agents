It correctly details the circumstances under which he gave it up and why he put it back on (at the urging of Armor King). It loses a few points for completeness because it doesn't mention that King taught his fighting skills to children, which contextualizes his role as a luchador/masked figure, though this is a minor omission for the specific question asked.",
