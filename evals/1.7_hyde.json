When a parent organization holds a controlling stake (typically more than 50% but less than 100%) in another entity, accounting standards require the parent to consolidate the subsidiary's entire financial position into its own balance sheet. However, because the parent does not own all of the subsidiary's net assets, the share belonging to outside shareholders must be reported separately. Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and U.S. GAAP, NCI is classified as a distinct component of total equity, rather than a liability, to reflect the minority shareholders' claim on the consolidated entity\u2019s net assets.",

Protectionism is also frequently employed as a tool for job preservation, preventing \"social dumping\" where lower labor costs abroad lead to domestic unemployment.

      "question": "what are bulls used for on a farm",
      "hypothetical_doc": "In agricultural management, bulls serve as the primary biological component for herd expansion and genetic improvement. Their most significant role is natural service, where a single sire is responsible for impregnating a group of cows during a defined breeding season. Beyond reproduction, bulls are selected based on specific performance traits\u2014such as growth rate, carcass quality, and temperament\u2014to enhance the lineage of the offspring, transitioning desirable characteristics to the next generation of beef or dairy cattle. While modern operations often utilize artificial insemination, \"cleanup bulls\" are frequently maintained to ensure high conception rates among cows that failed to conceive via laboratory methods. Historically, castrated bulls, known as oxen, were also utilized as draft animals for heavy labor, though contemporary farming primarily utilizes intact males for breeding or specialized seedstock production.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided documents, bulls are used on farms for several purposes:\n\n**Breeding and Herd Maintenance**\n- Bulls are traditionally kept with cows for natural mating and herd maintenance\n- They are used for artificial insemination (AI), where semen is collected and stored in liquid nitrogen for sale or later use\n- AI allows farmers to improve herd quality, introduce new bloodlines, and breed to multiple bulls in a season without owning them outright\n\n**Meat Production**\n- Bulls are raised for \"bull beef\" (uncastrated male beef)\n- They reach slaughter weight one to two months sooner than castrated males or females\n- They produce proportionately more lean muscle compared to other cattle\n\n**Genetic Improvement**\n- Ranchers keep bulls specifically for semen collection, which can be profitable\n- AI allows farmers to breed their best stock to higher-quality bulls than they could afford to purchase outright\n- Bulls may also be used in conjunction with embryo transfer programs",

An SLP consists of a single layer of output nodes connected directly to the inputs, utilizing a linear activation function to perform binary classification. Consequently, SLPs are restricted to solving linearly separable problems, such as the basic AND and OR logic gates. In contrast, an MLP incorporates one or more hidden layers between the input and output stages. By utilizing non-linear activation functions, such as sigmoid or ReLU, and the backpropagation algorithm for training, MLPs can model complex, non-linear relationships. This allows MLPs to overcome the limitations of the SLP, enabling the resolution of more sophisticated tasks like the XOR problem and intricate pattern recognition.",
