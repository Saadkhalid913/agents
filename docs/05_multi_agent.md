# Multi-Agent Systems

*Not yet implemented.*

Instead of one LLM doing everything, you give different LLMs different jobs --- one researches, one writes code, one reviews. They pass messages to each other through an orchestration layer. The interesting question is whether specialization actually helps, or whether one good model with a good prompt beats a committee.
