# Tool Calling

*Not yet implemented.*

Tool calling lets an LLM invoke external functions during a conversation --- search the web, query a database, run code. Instead of generating text, the model outputs a structured request to call a specific function. You execute it and feed the result back. This loop is what turns a chatbot into an agent.
